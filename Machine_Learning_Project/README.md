## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the comprehensive analysis and machine learning models.
- `model_training.ipynb`: A dedicated notebook for training machine learning models.
- `results.csv`: The output file containing the results of the model predictions.
- `test.zip` & `train.zip`: Zipped datasets for testing and training purposes.

## Objective
Image Classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify images of fruits. The dataset includes four classes: Apple only, Orange only, Banana only, and a mix of these fruits. 
The primary goal of this project is to apply various machine learning algorithms to a given dataset, train models, and predict outcomes with a focus on accuracy. 

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistics.
- Model Training: Applying different machine learning algorithms to train models on the training dataset.
- Evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.

## Results
The results of the model predictions are stored in `results.csv`. These results showcase the effectiveness of the applied machine learning techniques in making accurate predictions.
