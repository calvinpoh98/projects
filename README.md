# Project Overview

This repository contains a series of projects that was done under General Assembly's Data Science Course, each with its unique focus and application. Below is a summary of each project:

| Project | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| [Project 1](https://github.com/calvinpoh98/projects/tree/master/project_1) | Analysis of ACT and SAT standardized tests in the US. | Exploring participation rates and scores across states to understand implications for college admissions. |
| [Project 2](https://github.com/calvinpoh98/projects/tree/master/project_2) | Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge. | Predicting house sale prices in Ames, Iowa using Lasso & Ridge regression models for buyers and sellers. |
| [Project 3](https://github.com/calvinpoh98/projects/tree/master/project_3) | Classification of Reddit posts related to Toyota and Honda. | Using machine learning to help car enthusiasts correctly identify and classify posts related to car brands by using NLP and machine learning to find certain words or sentences that best suit the subreddit.  |
| [Project 4](https://github.com/calvinpoh98/projects/tree/master/project_4) | West Nile Virus Prediction in Chicago. | Analyzing and predicting the presence of West Nile Virus and conducting cost-benefit analysis for spraying pesticides. |

## New Projects
| Project | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| [ASP.NET_CA_Project](https://github.com/calvinpoh98/projects/tree/master/ASP.NET_CA_Project-main) | An ASP.NET project showcasing a robust account management system with session handling capabilities. | Demonstrating the implementation of MVC architecture, account management, and shopping cart features in a web application. |
| [LAPS](https://github.com/calvinpoh98/projects/tree/master/LAPS-main) | Leave Application Processing System developed with a Java backend and ReactJS frontend. | Streamlining the process of leave application in organizations with an efficient and user-friendly system. |
| [Image Classification](https://github.com/calvinpoh98/projects/tree/master/Machine_Learning_Project) | Image classification of 4 classes (Orange, Banana, Apple and Mixed).  | Tested different architects of deep learning networks and different training methodologies in order to acheive optimal results. Demonstrated the use of transferred learning and CUDA to train models.  |
| [OpenCV](https://github.com/calvinpoh98/projects/tree/master/Computer%20Vision) | A short OpenCV project and showcasing use of Docker.  | Using the OpenCV library and the [watershed](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d3/db4/tutorial_py_watershed.html) algorithm used for seperating objects based on their boundaries. This is a quick and easy way to segment rooms for a base model. This can be further improved by using more sophisticated deep learning models such as an Unet. |
